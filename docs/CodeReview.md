1. Game Logic:
The game logic appears to function correctly. The distribution of stones, capturing logic, and move validation seem well-implemented.
Player-specific logic is clear, enhancing readability and understanding of the code.
Game termination conditions are correctly implemented in isGameOver.
Player Interaction:
The player interaction, input validation, and turn-switching mechanisms are appropriately implemented in TextUI.
Exception handling is present for invalid inputs, enhancing robustness.
Pit and Store Interaction:
The interaction between pits, stores, and player-specific logic is consistent with the rules of Mancala.
Code Consistency:
Methods consistently follow naming conventions, enhancing code readability.

2. Clarity and Readability:
Code Structure:
The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns between classes (MancalaGame, Board, Pit, Store, Player, TextUI).
Methods are appropriately grouped, improving code readability.
Comments:
Comments have been added to explain the purpose of methods and important code sections.
Some additional comments could be beneficial, especially for complex algorithms.
Variable Names:
Variable names are mostly clear and meaningful, aiding in code comprehension.
Consider making variable names more descriptive where needed for improved clarity.
Magic Numbers:
Constants like 6, 11, and 12 have been used, which are self-explanatory in the context of Mancala. However, consider defining these as named constants for better clarity.

3. Style and Best Practices:
Exception Handling:
Exception handling is appropriately used for handling invalid inputs and moves.
Encapsulation:
The use of private fields and encapsulation is well-maintained in the Board class.
Whitespace and Formatting:
The code is properly formatted, and whitespace is used effectively.
Code Duplication:
Some code duplication is present in distributeStones. Consider refactoring to avoid redundancy.
Method Length:
The distributeStones method is quite lengthy. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused methods for better maintainability.

4. Potential Improvements:
Consider refactoring and breaking down long methods to enhance maintainability.
Add more comments for complex algorithms or critical sections.
Use constants for magic numbers to improve code readability.

5. Overall Summary:
The code provides a functional and clear implementation of the Mancala game.
It adheres to coding best practices and maintains a good balance between encapsulation and readability.
Some improvements, especially in the area of code duplication and method length, could enhance maintainability.
